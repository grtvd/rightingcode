			<h3 class="title">Dan Mastrobuono</h3>
			<p class="highlight tight-margin"><span class="strong">CIO</span> - Phelan Hallinan Diamond Jones<br/></p>

			<p>Robert (Bob) Davidson worked for FSS Acquisitions from June 2005 to March 2020 as a Software Development
				Consultant. His general responsibilities included requirements gathering, analysis, and the design of
				complex solutions using a variety of technologies. During his 14 years as a consultant with our company,
				he proved to be indispensable. It was evident early on that through his dedication and his prior
				experiences that we could rely on Bob to handle our more difficult development projects.</p>

			<p>Software developers are often myopic in their approach, but not Bob. He is truly gifted in his ability to
				quickly understand the bigger picture, which was reflected in his programming and development solutions.
				His development estimates were always accurate, and he often completed the projects ahead of schedule
				and below budget. Bob takes great pride in making sure his solutions are well documented so that others
				can quickly come up to speed and make changes when required. It was rare for Bob to have issues with his
				work once placed in production.</p>

			<p>Bob was instrumental in replacing an expensive and often problematic imaging system with an in-house
				developed document storage solution. He handled the architecting, the development of the new system, and
				the migration of millions of documents and images, all without error. The hard cost savings were
				hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the increase in reliability allowed for more productive users,
				thus increasing revenues.</p>

			<p>As a result of his successful track record, Bob was given the unwieldy task of leading our bridging team.
				Bridging involves the transfer of data from an in-house case management system to a multitude of
				middleware and third- party systems. Each system dictates its unique method of communication, and often
				the specifications change with little to no notice. Despite this, Bob was able to use his big picture
				intuition to develop a standardized approach that was flexible enough to allow change without
				significant rewrites. Once his team's solution was operational, Bob was able to fine-tune the solution
				for high reliability and reduce transaction costs by bundling requests within one request. This approach
				saved thousands monthly and enabled our company to become one of the most efficient at bridging
				data.</p>

			<p>Bob is always a team player, and his recommendations accepted without reservation or resentment due to
				his positive demeanor, passion, and approach to software development. I have no hesitation in saying
				that Bob would be an asset to any organization and I highly recommend him.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Collin Caputo</h3>
			<p class="highlight tight-margin"><span class="strong">Application Development Manager</span> - Full
				Spectrum Services/Phelan Hallinan Diamond Jones<br/>

			<p>My name is Collin Caputo and I am the Manager of Application Development with Full Spectrum Services. I
				had the pleasure of working with Bob Davidson for the past 16 years. Due to economic factors surrounding
				the COVID-19 outbreak, we were forced to let Bob go. I'm very sorry to see Bob go and wouldn't hesitate
				to hire him again if the opportunity arose.</p>

			<p>Bob has been a Senior Full Stack Developer for over 15 years with Full Spectrum. He helped design and
				develop the software applications used to send and receive mission critical, time sensitive and
				accounting data electronically with our clients. The application was written in Java/J2EE/J2SE/JSF using
				Apache-Tomcat webservers and SQL Server databases and has been in production for over 8 years.</p>

			<p>In 2019, Bob became our team leader for iOS application development where he designed and developed
				software supporting our staff in the field.</p>

			<p>Whoever is fortunate enough to hire Bob should feel confident in his technical abilities but more
				importantly his ability to design and develop solutions built for long term success.</p>

			<p>Should you have any additional questions about my experience working with Bob, I would be happy to
				discuss with you further.</p>
